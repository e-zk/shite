/bin/sh site generator tools

 About 
-------
This is the successor to the shlog[^1] project, separating each of its
main functions into serveral scripts:

 * rss.sh    - rss feed generation  
 * index.sh  - generate post index (list of posts in chronological order)  
 * shite     - simple script that wraps everything into one

All scripts source a .env file in the current directory. It is assumed all
scripts are run at the root of the static site heirachy.

These scripts have been tested on the latest OpenBSD-current and the latest
Ubuntu on WSL2.
