 shite 
=======
site generator tools in /bin/sh.

 Dependencies
--------------
shite depends on the lowdown[^0] Markdown 'translator' to convert Markdown
into HTML. If your OS is POSIX-compliant out of the box, this is the only
program you will need to install.

 * lowdown
 * find
 * a POSIX-compliant /bin/sh

 About 
-------
shite is the successor to the shlog[^1] project, separating each of its
main functions into serveral scripts:

 * rss.sh    - generates rss feed of posts  
 * index.sh  - generates a html page listing posts in chronological order
 * shite     - finds and converts html -> markdown

All scripts source a .env file in the current directory. For an template see
.env.template. It is assumed all scripts are run at the root of the static
site's heirachy.

These scripts have been tested on the latest OpenBSD-current and the latest
Ubuntu on WSL2.

 Usage 
-------

 1. Copy .env.template to the root of your static site as ./.env
 2. Edit .env to your specifications
 3. Populate $html_dir with:
    - footer.html     - footer content
    - head.html       - <head> content
    - header.html     - header/nav content
    - index_head.html - post index prefix
      This is placed before posts are listed
    - index_tail.html - post index postfix
      This is placed after posts are listed
