/bin/sh site generator tools

 About 
-------
This is the successor to the shlog[^1] project, separating each of its
main functions into serveral scripts:

 * common.rc - houses common script functions and variables  
 * rss.sh    - rss feed generation  
 * update.sh - convert new posts from markdown -> html  
 * index.sh  - generate post index (list of posts in chronological order)  

The main difference between these scripts and shlog is that these scripts
are easier for _me_ to maintain without worrying about Linux compat,
OS-specific edge cases, etc.

These scripts have been tested on the latest OpenBSD-current and nothing else.
At this stage, don't expect it to work anywhere else. It is what it claims to
be; shite.

 Usage 
-------

Static HTML is stored in files located under the $html_dir:

 * $html_dir/head.html   - the <head>
 * $html_dir/nav.html    - additional site header content/navigation
 * $html_dir/footer.html - additional page footer content
 * $html_dir/pasts.html  - added to the beginning of the post list (this is
                           only used on the $post_index page)

With the exception of posts.html the content of these files are added to every
generated page in their relevant places.
