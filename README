/bin/sh site generator tools


 About 
-------

This is the successor to the shlog[^1] project, separating each of its
main functions into serveral scripts:

 * common.rc - houses common script functions and variables  
 * rss.sh    - rss feed generation  
 * update.sh - convert new posts from markdown -> html  
 * index.sh  - generate post index (list of posts in chronological order)  

The main difference between these scripts and shlog is that these scripts
are easier for _me_ to maintain without worrying about Linux compat,
OS-specific edge cases, etc.

These scripts have been tested on the latest OpenBSD-current and nothing else.


 Usage 
-------

 1. Configure file locations, site url and name in common.rc
 2. Run update.sh to 'compile' markdown posts
 3. Run index.sh to generate the post index page 
 4. Run rss.sh to update the post rss feed
